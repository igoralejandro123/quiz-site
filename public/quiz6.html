      <p>
        Female squirting, also known as “female ejaculation”, is an intense sexual response in which some women expel a clear liquid through the urethra during orgasm or very strong arousal.
      </p>

      <p>
        This happens when a woman is properly stimulated, especially in the G-spot area, reaching a very high level of pleasure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not all women have experienced this, and many men don’t know how to make it happen — but with the right techniques, any woman can achieve it!
